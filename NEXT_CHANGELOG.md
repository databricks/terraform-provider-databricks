# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v1.143.0

### Important Changes

* `databricks_app` now updates apps through the asynchronous Apps update API ([#6151](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6151)).
  The synchronous update API ignored `compute_size`, `compute_min_instances`, and
  `compute_max_instances`, so changes to them never took effect; they are now applied. As
  before, an update replaces the app's updatable fields with the configuration, so fields
  omitted from it are cleared. That now also covers the fields the synchronous API skipped: an
  omitted `compute_size` resets to `MEDIUM`, omitted `compute_min_instances` and
  `compute_max_instances` disable horizontal scaling, and an omitted `git_source` clears the
  app's default git source. Updates now wait for the app update to reach `SUCCEEDED`.

### Breaking Changes

### New Features and Improvements
* Add resource and data sources for `databricks_assume_group_restricted_sharing_group`.
* Add `personal_access_token_wo` and `personal_access_token_wo_version` write-only attributes to `databricks_git_credential` resource ([#6088](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6088)).
* Add `options_wo` and `options_wo_version` write-only attributes to `databricks_connection` resource ([#6088](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6088)).

### Bug Fixes
* Keep the configured values of the `pem_key_passphrase`, `ssl_keystore_key`, `ssl_key_password` and `schema_registry_api_secret` options of `databricks_connection`, which the API doesn't return, to avoid a perpetual diff ([#6088](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6088)).
* Ignore whitespace-only differences in PEM-encoded options of `databricks_connection`, such as `userProvidedServerCertificate`, to avoid a perpetual diff ([#6088](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6088)).

* Fix column handling on a `VIEW` in `databricks_sql_table` ([#5958](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/5958)). A view's columns are derived from its query, but the provider treated them like table columns and emitted DDL that Databricks rejects with a `PARSE_SYNTAX_ERROR`: `NOT NULL` in `CREATE VIEW`, and `ALTER VIEW ... ADD COLUMN` / `DROP COLUMN` / `RENAME COLUMN` / `ALTER COLUMN ... SET|DROP NOT NULL` on update. Editing the query of a view that has column comments also dropped those comments, because `ALTER VIEW ... AS` clears them and the provider did not re-apply them in the same run. For views, the provider now applies only column comments (via `COMMENT ON COLUMN`), matches columns by name rather than by position, re-applies the configured comments whenever the view definition changes, and suppresses diffs on `column.nullable`, whose server-derived value cannot be set from the configuration.
