# databricks_disable_legacy_access_setting Resource

-> This resource can only be used with a workspace-level provider!

The `databricks_disable_legacy_access_setting` resource allows you to disable legacy access. It has the following impact:

1. Disables direct access to Hive Metastores from the workspace. However, you can still access a Hive Metastore through Hive Metastore federation.
2. Disables Fallback Mode on any External Location access from the workspace.
3. Disables Databricks Runtime versions prior to 13.3LTS.

It may take 5 minutes to take effect and requires a restart of clusters and SQL warehouses.
Please also set the default namespace using [databricks_default_namespace_setting](default_namespace_setting.md) to any value other than `hive_metastore` to avoid potential issues.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "databricks_disable_legacy_access_setting" "this" {

    value = true
  }
