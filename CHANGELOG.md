# Version changelog

## 0.4.5

* Cross-linked resource documentation ([#1027](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/1027)).
* Added Azure example for sql_global_config ([#1028](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/1028)).

Updated dependency versions:

* Bump google.golang.org/api from 0.63.0 to 0.65.0

## 0.4.4

* Added support for [running provider in a debug mode](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/debugging#running-terraform-with-a-provider-in-debug-mode) from Visual Studio Code through `Debug Provider` run configuration in order to troubleshoot more complicated issues.
* Allowed managing of libraries on `databricks_cluster` outside of Terraform state for resources without any `library` configuration blocks. This should simplify PaaS-like CI/CD workflows ([#1024](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/1024)).
* Added experimental resources.

**Behavior changes**

* Whenever library is installed on `databricks_cluster` without any [`library` configuration blocks](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databrickslabs/databricks/latest/docs/resources/cluster#library-configuration-block), it won't be removed anymore.

## 0.4.3

* Added support for `databricks_permissions` for `databricks_mlflow_experiment` and `databricks_mlflow_model` ([#1013](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/1013)).
* Added `Using XXX auth` explanation to HTTP 403 errors, which should help troubleshooting misconfigured authentication or provider aliasing. Example error message now looks like: *cannot create group: /2.0/preview/scim/v2/Groups is only accessible by admins. Using databricks-cli auth: host=https://XXX.cloud.databricks.com/, token=`***REDACTED***`, profile=demo.* All sensitive configuration parameters (`token`, `password`, and `azure_client_secret`) are redacted and replaced with `***REDACTED***` ([#821](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/821)).
* Improved documentation with regards to public subnets in AWS quick start ([#1005](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/1005)).
* Added `databricks_mount` code genration for [exporter](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databrickslabs/databricks/latest/docs/guides/experimental-exporter) tooling ([#1006](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/1006)).
* Increase dependency check frequency ([#1007](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/1007)).
* Added experimental resources.

## 0.4.2

* Added optional `auth_type` provider conf to enforce specific auth type to be used in very rare cases, where a single Terraform state manages Databricks workspaces on more than one cloud and `More than one authorization method configured` error is a false positive. Valid values are `pat`, `basic`, `azure-client-secret`, `azure-msi`, `azure-cli`, and `databricks-cli` ([#1000](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/1000)).
* Added `DBC` format support for `databricks_notebook` ([#989](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/989)). 
* Fixed creating new `databricks_mws_workspaces` with `token {}` block ([#994](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/994)).
* Added automated documentation formatting with `make fmt-docs`, so that all HCL examples look consistent ([#999](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/999)).
* Increased codebase unit test coverage to 91% to improve stability ([#996](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/996), [#992](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/992), [#991](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/991), [#990](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/990)).

Updated dependency versions:

* Bump github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-sdk/v2 from 2.10.0 to 2.10.1 

## 0.4.1

* Added `databricks_library` resource to install library on `databricks_cluster` ([#904](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/904)).
* Added `databricks_clusters` data resource to list all clusters in the workspace, which might be used to install `databricks_library` on all clusters ([#955](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/955)).
* Fixed refresh of `library` blocks on a stopped `databricks_cluster` ([#952](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/952)).
* Whenever a library fails to get installed on a running `databricks_cluster`, we now automatically remove this library, so that the clean state of managed libraries is properly maintained. Without this fix users had to manually go to Clusters UI and remove library from a cluster, where it failed to install. Libraries add up to CREATE and UPDATE timeouts of `databricks_cluster` resource. ([#599](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/599)).
* Added `token` block to `databricks_mws_workspaces` to avoid unnecessary provider aliasing ([#957](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/957)).
* Fixed disabling `databricks_global_init_script` ([#958](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/958)).
* Fixed configuration drift issues with `aws_attributes`, `azure_attributes`, `gcp_attributes`, and `email_notifications` configuration blocks in `databricks_cluster`, `databricks_job`, and `databricks_instance_pool` resources ([#981](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/981)).
* Improved Databricks CLI auth by eagerly resolving `host`, `username`, `password`, and `token` from the specified `profile`. Added explicit logging of auth parameters in debug logs ([#965](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/965)).
* TLS timeouts, which may occur during Azure MSI auth, are no longer failing API requests and retried within a normal policy ([#966](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/966)).
* `debug_headers` provider conf is also logging the `Host` header to help troubleshooting auth issues ([#964](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/964)).
* Added new experimental resources and increased test coverage.

* Added `external_id` to `databricks_user` and `databricks_group` ([#927](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/927)).
* Fixed `databricks_repo` creation corner cases on MS Windows OS ([#911](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/911)).
* Fixed configuration drift for `databricks_cluster`.`aws_attributes`.`zone_id` with `auto`, which resulted in unwanted cluster restarts ([#937](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/937)).
* Added new experimental resources, increased test coverage, and automated integration testing infrastructure.

## 0.3.7

* Added `databricks_obo_token` resource to create On-Behalf-Of tokens for a Service Principal in Databricks workspaces on AWS. It is very useful, when you want to provision resources within a workspace through narrowly-scoped service principal, that has no access to other workspaces within the same Databricks Account ([#736](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/736))

* Added more selectors to `databricks_node_type` data source ([#723](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/723))
* Azure auth with SPN now uses AAD token by default instead of PAT. Previous behavior (using PAT) could be restored by setting `azure_use_pat_for_spn` to `true` ([#721](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/721))
* `deployment_name` for `databricks_mws_workspaces` is now optional, how it should have been. This enables creation of Databricks workspaces without an account prefix.
* To replicate default behavior of Databricks SQL UI, `enable_photon` is now `true` by default for `databricks_sql_endpoint`.
* Various documentation and bugfixes

Updated dependency versions:

* Bump github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go from 1.38.51 to 1.38.71

* All resource imports are now making call to corresponding Databricks API by default ([#471](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/471)).

**Behavior changes**
* Removed deprecated `library_jar`, `library_egg`, `library_whl`, `library_pypi`, `library_cran`, and `library_maven` from `databricks_cluster` and `databricks_job` in favor of more API-transparent [library](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databrickslabs/databricks/latest/docs/resources/cluster#library-configuration-block) configuration block.

* Migrated build from TravisCI to GitHub Actions.
* Fixed custom `config_file` issue configuration handling ([#420](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/420)).

**Deprecations**

* `databricks_notebook` & `databricks_dbfs_file` field `content` is deprecated and would be renamed to `content_base64` to further increase clarity. 
* `databricks_dbfs_file` has got `content`, `content_b64_md5`, `overwrite`, `mkdirs`, `validate_remote_file` fields deprecated and they will be removed in the next version, where critical code path will be shared with `databricks_notebook`.
* `network_error_messages` and `verify_workspace_runnning` from `databricks_mws_workspaces` is deprecated and going to be removed in 0.3.
* `error_messages` from `databricks_mws_networks` are deprecated and would be removed in 0.3.
* `ebs_volume_type` and `azure_disk_volume_type` from `databricks_instance_pool` is going to be moved to `disk_type` sub-block in 0.3, which means you'll slightly have to modify configuration while migrating to 0.3. Computed field `default_tags` is going to be removed from resource. This is done to further increase maintainability of provider in the future.

Updated dependency versions:

* github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go 35.36
* github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp 0.6.8

* Added [Azure Key Vault support](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/381) for `databricks_secret_scope` for Azure CLI authenticated users.
* Added [is_pinned](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/348) support for `databricks_cluster` resource.
* Fixed restarting cluster on changes in cluster configuration aren't related to the cluster configuration ([issue #379](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/379))
* Fixed issue [#383](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/383) by cleaning up clusters that fail to start.
* Fixed issue [#382](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/382) by ignoring any incoming changes to deployment name of `databricks_mws_workspaces`, as well as propagating the right error messages.
* Internal: API for retrieval of the cluster events.
* Increased code coverage to 71%.

Updated dependency versions:

* github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest v0.11.9

* github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/adal v0.9.4
* github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/azure/auth v0.5.2
* github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/azure/cli v0.4.1
* gopkg.in/ini.v1 v1.61.0

**Deprecations**
* `databricks_scim_user` is no longer receiving fixes and will be removed in `0.3`, please rewrite using the `databricks_user` resource, which has more consistent semantics with `databricks_group` and works better with identity provider SCIM sync.

* `databricks_default_user_roles` is no longer receiving fixes and will be removed in `0.3`, please rewrite using `databricks_user` & `databricks_group` resources.

**Behavior changes**
* State changes to legacy `spark.databricks.delta.preview.enabled` config option are [now ignored](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/334) by `databricks_job` & `databricks_cluster`
* Libraries, which are installed on all clusters and are not part of cluster resource definition, won't be waited for INSTALLED status
* Fixed "[Secret scope ACL is MANAGE for all users by default](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/326)" ([issue 322](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/322)).  If you were relying on setting `MANAGE` permission to all users by default, you need to add `initial_manage_principal = "users"` to your `resource "databricks_secret_scope"` declaration. 

## 0.2.5

* Added support for [local disk encryption](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/313)
* Added more reliable [indication about Azure environment](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/312) and fixed azure auth issue for Terraform 0.13

## 0.2.4

* Added [Azure CLI authentication](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/blob/master/docs/index.md#authenticating-with-azure-cli) to bridge the gap of local development workflows and let more people use the provider.
* All authentication is completely [lazy-initialized](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/270), which makes it provider overall more stable.
* Significantly increased [unit test coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks), which runs before every merge of a pull request.
* Introduced constantly running integration test suite environments: azsp, azcli & awsmt
* Numerous stability improvements for clusters, mounts, libraries, notebooks, files, authentication and TLS connectivity.
* Added ability to mount storage without explicitly defining a cluster, though it will still launch auto-terminating `terraform-mount` cluster to perform the mount.
* `databricks_cluster` & `databricks_job` now share significant portion of configuration wiring code, therefore increasing the stability of codebase.
* Added support for Terraform 0.13 [local builds](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/281) for those who develop or cannot wait for next release.
* Added AWS IAM Policy [data helpers](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/255) to simplify new deployments.
* [Migrated all documentation](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/250) to Terraform Registry format, therefore having a single always-accurate place for end-user guides.
* Internally, codebase [has been split](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/224) into multiple packages, which should make further contributions simpler.

Updated dependency versions:

* github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest v0.11.4
* github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/adal v0.9.2
* github.com/Azure/go-autorest/autorest/azure/auth v0.5.1
* github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go v1.34.13
* gopkg.in/ini.v1 v1.60.2

**Deprecations**
* `library_*` is no longer receiving fixes and will be removed in `0.3`, please rewrite cluster & job resources to use [`library` configuration block](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/blob/master/docs/resources/cluster.md#library-configuration-block).
* `basic_auth` provider block is no longer receiving fixesand will be removed in `0.3`, please use `username` and `password` options
* `azure_auth` provider block is no longer receiving fixesand will be removed in `0.3`, please use `azure_*` options 

**Behavior changes**
* Previously, mounts code paths were different functions. This release unifies them to be a single testable codebase with different configuration options & re-use of the critical code paths. For maintainability reasons, there's no longer check performed on container & storage account names, but rather on high-level *mount source uri*.
