# databricks_grant Resource

-> This article refers to the privileges and inheritance model in Privilege Model version 1.0. If you created your metastore during the public preview (before August 25, 2022), you can upgrade to Privilege Model version 1.0 following [Upgrade to privilege inheritance](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/hive-metastore.html)

-> Most of Unity Catalog APIs are only accessible via **workspace-level APIs**. This design may change in the future. Account-level principal grants can be assigned with any valid workspace as the Unity Catalog is decoupled from specific workspaces. More information in [the official documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/index.html).

In Unity Catalog all users initially have no access to data. Only Metastore Admins can create objects and can grant/revoke access on individual objects to users and groups. Every securable object in Unity Catalog has an owner. The owner can be any account-level user or group, called principals in general. The principal that creates an object becomes its owner. Owners receive `ALL_PRIVILEGES` on the securable object (e.g., `SELECT` and `MODIFY` on a table), as well as the permission to grant privileges to other principals.

Securable objects are hierarchical and privileges are inherited downward. The highest level object that privileges are inherited from is the catalog. This means that granting a privilege on a catalog or schema automatically grants the privilege to all current and future objects within the catalog or schema. Privileges that are granted on a metastore are not inherited.

Every `databricks_grant` resource must have exactly one securable identifier and the following arguments:

- `principal` - User name, group name or service principal application ID.
- `privileges` - One or more privileges that are specific to a securable type.

For the latest list of privilege types that apply to each securable object in Unity Catalog, please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/data-governance/unity-catalog/manage-privileges/privileges.html#privilege-types-by-securable-object-in-unity-catalog)

Terraform will handle any configuration drift for the specified principal on every `terraform apply` run, even when grants are changed outside of Terraform state.

See [databricks_grants](grants.md) for the list of privilege types that apply to each securable object.

## Examples
