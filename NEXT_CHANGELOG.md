### Internal Changes

* Pass `excludedAttributes=entitlements` on SCIM `/Me` requests ([#5725](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/5725)).

  The provider only needs identity fields (`userName`, `id`, `externalId`) from `/Me`, never entitlements. Skipping the entitlement computation avoids an expensive `getEffectivePermissions` traversal on the SCIM backend, which has caused incidents on workspaces with large grant counts.
