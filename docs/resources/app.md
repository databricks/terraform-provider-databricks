# databricks_app Resource

-> This feature is in [Public Preview](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/release-types.html).

[Databricks Apps](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/index.html) run directly on a customerâ€™s Databricks instance, integrate with their data, use and extend Databricks services, and enable users to interact through single sign-on. This resource creates the application but does not handle app deployment, which should be handled separately as part of your CI/CD pipeline.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "databricks_app" "this" {
  name        = "my-custom-app"
  description = "My app"

  resources = [{
    name = "sql-warehouse"
    sql_warehouse = {
      id         = "e9ca293f79a74b5c"
      permission = "CAN_MANAGE"
    }
    },
    {
      name = "serving-endpoint"
      serving_endpoint = {
        name       = "databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct"
        permission = "CAN_MANAGE"
      }
    },
    {
      name = "job"
      job = {
        id         = "1234"
