# databricks_mws_customer_managed_keys Resource

-> Initialize provider with `alias = "mws"`, `host  = "https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com"` and use `provider = databricks.mws`

This resource to configure KMS keys for new workspaces within AWS or GCP. This is to support the following features:

* [Customer-managed keys for managed services](https://docs.databricks.com/security/keys/customer-managed-keys-managed-services-aws.html): Encrypt the workspaceâ€™s managed services data in the control plane, including notebooks, secrets, Databricks SQL queries, and Databricks SQL query history  with a CMK.
* [Customer-managed keys for workspace storage](https://docs.databricks.com/security/keys/customer-managed-keys-storage-aws.html): Encrypt the workspace's root S3 bucket and clusters' EBS volumes with a CMK.

Please follow this [complete runnable example](../guides/aws-workspace.md) with new VPC and new workspace setup. Please pay special attention to the fact that there you have two different instances of a databricks provider - one for deploying workspaces (with `host="https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/"`) and another for the workspace you've created with databricks_mws_workspaces resource. If you want both creation of workspaces & clusters within workspace within the same terraform module (essentially same directory), you should use the provider aliasing feature of Terraform. We strongly recommend having one Terraform module for creation of workspace + PAT token and the rest in different modules.

## Example Usage

-> If you've used the resource before, please add `use_cases = ["MANAGED_SERVICES"]` to keep the previous behaviour.

### Customer-managed key for managed services

You must configure this during workspace creation
