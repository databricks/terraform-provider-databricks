# databricks_group Data Source

-> **Note** If you have a fully automated setup with workspaces created by [databricks_mws_workspaces](../resources/mws_workspaces.md) or [azurerm_databricks_workspace](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/databricks_workspace), please make sure to add [depends_on attribute](../guides/troubleshooting.md#data-resources-and-authentication-is-not-configured-errors) in order to prevent _default auth: cannot configure default credentials_ errors.

Retrieves information about [databricks_group](../resources/group.md) members, entitlements and instance profiles.

## Example Usage

Adding user to administrative group

```hcl
data "databricks_group" "admins" {
  display_name = "admins"
}

resource "databricks_user" "me" {
  user_name = "me@example.com"
}

resource "databricks_group_member" "my_member_a" {
  group_id  = data.databricks_group.admins.id
  member_id = databricks_user.me.id
}
```
