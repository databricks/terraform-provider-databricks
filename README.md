# Databricks Terraform Provider

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks)

[Documentation](https://databrickslabs.github.io/terraform-provider-databricks/provider/) | [Contributing and Development Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)

To quickly install the binary please execute the following curl command in your shell or [install provider from source](CONTRIBUTING.md#installing-from-source).

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databrickslabs/databricks-terraform/master/godownloader-databricks-provider.sh | bash -s -- -b $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins
```

Then create a small sample file, named `main.tf` with approximately following contents. Replace `<your PAT token>` with newly created [PAT Token](https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/api/latest/authentication.html). It will create [a simple cluster](https://databrickslabs.github.io/terraform-provider-databricks/resources/cluster/).

```terraform
provider "databricks" {
  host = "https://abc-defg-024.cloud.databricks.com/"
  token = "<your PAT token>"
}

resource "databricks_cluster" "shared_autoscaling" {
  cluster_name            = "Shared Autoscaling"
  spark_version           = "6.6.x-scala2.11"
  node_type_id            = "i3.xlarge"
  autotermination_minutes = 20

  autoscale {
    min_workers = 1
    max_workers = 50
  }
}
```

Then run `terraform init` then `terraform apply` to apply the hcl code to your Databricks workspace. Please refer to the [end-user documentation](https://databrickslabs.github.io/terraform-provider-databricks/provider/) for detailed use of the provider. Also refer to these [examples](examples/) for more scenarios.
