# databricks_apps_settings_custom_template Resource
Custom App Templates store the metadata of custom app code hosted in an external Git repository, enabling users to reuse boilerplate code when creating apps.

### Use Cases

Custom Templates can be used for standardizing app code and establishing best practices when creating apps.

### Permissions

Custom Templates are objects created at the workspace level. As such, management operations are performed by workspace admins.

The workspace admin does not need permissions on the Git repository to add Custom Templates into the workspace. However, the user installing from the custom template needs Read (or higher) permissions to the repository.

**Note:** Each workspace is limited to 20 Custom Templates in total.


## Example Usage
### Basic Example

This example creates a Custom Template in the workspace with the specified name.

```hcl
resource "databricks_apps_settings_custom_template" "this" {
  name         = "my-custom-template"
  description  = "A sample custom app template"
  git_repo     = "https://github.com/example/repo.git"
  path         = "path-to-template"
  git_provider = "github"
  manifest     = {
    version    = 1
    name       = "my-custom-app"
  }
}
```

### Example with API Scopes

This example creates a custom template that declares required user API scopes.

```hcl
resource "databricks_apps_settings_custom_template" "api_scopes_example" {
  name         = "my-api-template"
  description  = "A template that requests user API scopes"
  git_repo     = "https://github.com/example/my-app.git"
  path         = "templates/app"
  git_provider = "github"

  manifest = {
    version     = 1
    name        = "my-databricks-app"
    description = "This app requires the SQL API scope."
    user_api_scopes = [
      "sql"
    ]
  }
}
```

### Example with Resource Requirements

This example defines a template that requests specific workspace resources with permissions granted.

```hcl
resource "databricks_apps_settings_custom_template" "resources_example" {
  name         = "my-resource-template"
  description  = "Template that requires secret and SQL warehouse access"
  git_repo     = "https://github.com/example/resource-app.git"
  path         = "resource-template"
  git_provider = "github"
  manifest = {
    version     = 1
    name        = "resource-consuming-app"
    description = "This app requires access to a secret and SQL warehouse."
    resource_specs = [
      {
        name        = "my-secret"
        description = "A secret needed by the app"
        secret_spec = {
          permission = "READ"
        }
      },
      {
        name        = "warehouse"
        description = "Warehouse access"
        sql_warehouse_spec = {
          permission = "CAN_USE"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
