# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v1.117.0

### Breaking Changes

### New Features and Improvements

### Bug Fixes
* Fixed `databricks_sql_endpoint` resource failing when `min_num_clusters` was changed outside of Terraform by adding `Default: 1` to match `max_num_clusters` behavior ([#5294](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/issues/5294)).

* Fix `databricks_external_location` so that creating a resource with `enable_file_events = false` is sent in the POST request. Previously the field was silently dropped (Go SDK marshals the bool with `omitempty`), so the server applied its `true` default and `effective_enable_file_events` came back `true`.
