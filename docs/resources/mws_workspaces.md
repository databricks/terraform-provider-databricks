# databricks_mws_workspaces resource

-> **Note** This resource has an evolving API, which will change in the upcoming versions of the provider in order to simplify user experience.

This resource allows you to set up [workspaces in E2 architecture on AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/overview.html#e2-architecture-1). Please follow this [complete runnable example](../guides/aws-workspace.md) with new VPC and new workspace setup.

-> **Note** Initialize provider with `alias = "mws"` and use `provider = databricks.mws` for all `databricks_mws_*` resources. We require all `databricks_mws_*` resources to be created within its own dedicated terraform module of your environment. Usually this module creates VPC and IAM roles as well. Code that creates workspaces and code that [manages workspaces](../guides/workspace-management.md) must be in separate terraform modules to avoid common confusion between `provider = databricks.mws` and `provider = databricks.created_workspace`. This is why we specify `databricks_host` and `databricks_token` outputs, that have to be used in the latter modules:

```hcl
provider "databricks" {
  host = module.ai.databricks_host
  token = module.ai.databricks_token
}
```

## Example Usage

![Simplest multiworkspace](https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/raw/master/docs/simplest-multiworkspace.png)

To get workspace running, you have to configure a couple of things:

 * [databricks_mws_credentials](mws_credentials.md) - You can share a credentials (cross-account IAM role) configuration ID with multiple workspaces. It is not required to create a new one for each workspace.
 * [databricks_mws_storage_configurations](mws_storage_configurations.md) - You can share a root S3 bucket with multiple workspaces in a single account. You do not have to create new ones for each workspace. If you share a root S3 bucket for multiple workspaces in an account, data on the root S3 bucket is partitioned into separate directories by workspace.
 * [databricks_mws_networks](mws_networks.md) - (optional, but recommended) You can share one [customer-managed VPC](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/customer-managed-vpc.html) with multiple workspaces in a single account. You do not have to create a new VPC for each workspace. However, you cannot reuse subnets or security groups with other resources, including other workspaces or non-Databricks resources. If you plan to share one VPC with multiple workspaces, be sure to size your VPC and subnets accordingly. Because a Databricks [databricks_mws_networks](mws_networks.md) encapsulates this information, you cannot reuse it across workspaces.
 * [databricks_mws_customer_managed_keys](mws_customer_managed_keys.md) - You can share a customer-managed key across workspaces.

## Workspace with Databricks-Managed VPC

![VPCs](https://docs.databricks.com/_images/customer-managed-vpc.png)

By default, Databricks creates a VPC in your AWS account for each workspace. Databricks uses it for running clusters in the workspace. Optionally, you can use your VPC for the workspace, using the feature customer-managed VPC. Databricks recommends that you provide your VPC with [databricks_mws_networks](mws_networks.md) so that you can configure it according to your organization’s enterprise cloud standards while still conforming to Databricks requirements. You cannot migrate an existing workspace to your VPC. Please see the difference described through IAM policy actions [on this page](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/account-api/iam-role.html).

```hcl
variable "databricks_account_id" {
  description = "Account Id that could be found in the bottom left corner of https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/"
}

resource "random_string" "naming" {
  special = false
  upper   = false
  length  = 6
}

locals {
  prefix = "dltp${random_string.naming.result}"
}

  external_id = var.databricks_account_id

  ignore_public_acls = true
}

}
```

In order to create a [Databricks Workspace that leverages AWS PrivateLink](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/privatelink.html) please ensure that you have read and understood the [Enable Private Link](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/cloud-configurations/aws/privatelink.html) documentation and then customise the example above with the relevant examples from [mws_vpc_endpoint](mws_vpc_endpoint.md), [mws_private_access_settings](mws_private_access_settings.md) and [mws_networks](mws_networks.md).

## Argument Reference

-> **Note** All workspaces would be verified to get into runnable state or deleted upon failure. You can only update `credentials_id`, `network_id`, and `storage_customer_managed_key_id` on a running workspace.

The following arguments are available and cannot be changed after workspace is created:

* `account_id` - Account Id that could be found in the bottom left corner of [Accounts Console](https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com/).
* `managed_services_customer_managed_key_id` - (Optional) `customer_managed_key_id` from [customer managed keys](mws_customer_managed_keys.md) with `use_cases` set to `MANAGED_SERVICES`. This is used to encrypt the workspace's notebook and secret data in the control plane.
* `deployment_name` - (Optional) part of URL: `https://<deployment-name>.cloud.databricks.com`
* `workspace_name` - name of the workspace, will appear on UI
* `aws_region` - AWS region of VPC
* `storage_configuration_id` - `storage_configuration_id` from [storage configuration](mws_storage_configurations.md)
* `private_access_settings_id` - (Optional) Canonical unique identifier of [databricks_mws_private_access_settings](mws_private_access_settings.md) in Databricks Account

## token block

You can specify a `token` block in the body of workspace resource, so that Terraform manages the refresh of PAT token for the deployment user. The other option is to create [databricks_obo_token](obo_token.md), though it requires Premium or Enterprise plan enabled as well as more complex setup. Token block exposes `token_value`, that holds sensitive PAT token and optionally it can accept two arugments:

* `comment` - (Optional) Comment, that will appear in "User Settings / Access Tokens" page on Workspace UI. By default it's "Terraform PAT".
* `lifetime_seconds` - (Optional) Token expiry lifetime. By default its 2592000 (30 days).

The following arguments could be modified after the workspace is running:

* `network_id` - (Optional) `network_id` from [networks](mws_networks.md). Modifying [networks on running workspaces](mws_networks.md#modifying-networks-on-running-workspaces) would require three separate `terraform apply` steps.
* `credentials_id` - `credentials_id` from [credentials](mws_credentials.md)
* `storage_customer_managed_key_id` - (Optional) `customer_managed_key_id` from [customer managed keys](mws_customer_managed_keys.md) with `use_cases` set to `STORAGE`. This is used to encrypt the DBFS Storage & Cluster EBS Volumes.


## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - Canonical unique identifier for the workspace.
* `workspace_status_message` - (String) updates on workspace status
* `workspace_status` - (String) workspace status
* `creation_time` - (Integer) time when workspace was created
* `workspace_url` - (String) URL of the workspace

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify `create`, `read` and `update` timeouts. It usually takes 5-7 minutes to provision Databricks E2 Workspace and another couple of minutes for your local DNS caches to resolve. Please launch `TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply` whenever you observe timeout issues.

```hcl
timeouts {
  create = "30m"
  read   = "10m"
  update = "20m
}
```

You can reset local DNS caches before provisioning new workspaces with one of the following commands:

* Linux - `sudo /etc/init.d/nscd restart`
* Mac OS Sierra, X El Capitan, X Mavericks, X Mountain Lion, or X Lion - `sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder`
* Mac OS X Yosemite - `sudo discoveryutil udnsflushcaches`
* Mac OS X Snow Leopard - `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`
* Mac OS X Leopard and below - `sudo lookupd -flushcache`
