# databricks_schemas Data Source

-> **Note** This data source can only be used with a workspace-level provider!

-> **Note** If you have a fully automated setup with workspaces created by [databricks_mws_workspaces](../resources/mws_workspaces.md) or [azurerm_databricks_workspace](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/databricks_workspace), please make sure to add [depends_on attribute](../guides/troubleshooting.md#data-resources-and-authentication-is-not-configured-errors) in order to prevent _default auth: cannot configure default credentials_ errors.

data "databricks_schemas" "sandbox" {
  catalog_name = "sandbox"
}

  value = data.databricks_schemas.sandbox
}
