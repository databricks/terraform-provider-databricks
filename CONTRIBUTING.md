We happily welcome contributions to databricks-terraform. We use GitHub Issues to track community reported issues and GitHub Pull Requests for accepting changes.

## Installing from source

The following command (tested on Ubuntu 20.04) will install `make`, `golang`, `git` with all of the dependent packages as well as Databricks Terrafrom provider from sources. Required version of GoLang is at least 1.13. Required version of terraform is at least 0.12. 

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install make golang git -y
git clone https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks.git
cd terraform-provider-databricks
make install
```

Now your plugin for the Databricks Terraform provider is installed correctly. You can actually use the provider. 

## Developing provider

After installing necessary software for building provider from sources, you should install `golangci-lint` and `gotestsum` in order to run `make test`.

Make sure you have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`:
```
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Installing `golangci-lint`:
```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin v1.27.0
$(go env GOPATH)/bin/golangci-lint
```

Installing `gotestsum`:
```bash
go get gotest.tools/gotestsum
```

After this, you should be able to run `make test`.

## Developing with Visual Studio Code Devcontainers

This project has configuration for working with [Visual Studio Code Devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) - this allows you to containerise your development prerequisites (e.g. golang, terraform). To use this you will need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

To get started, clone this repo and open the folder with Visual Studio Code. If you don't have the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) then you should be prompted to install it.

Once the folder is loaded and the extension is installed you should be prompted to re-open the folder in a devcontainer. This will built and run the container image with the correct tools (and versions) ready to start working on and building the code. The in-built terminal will launch a shell inside the container for running `make` commands etc.

See the docs for more details on working with [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

## Building and Installing with Docker

To install and build the code if you dont want to install golang, terraform, etc. All you need is docker and git.

First make sure you clone the repository and you are in the directory.

Then build the docker image with this command:

```bash
$ docker build -t databricks-terraform . 
```

Then run the execute the terraform binary via the following command and volume mount. Make sure that you are in the directory
 with the terraform code. The following command you can execute the following commands and additional ones as part of 
 the terraform binary.
 
```bash
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workpace -w /workpace databricks-terraform init
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workpace -w /workpace databricks-terraform plan
$ docker run -it -v $(pwd):/workpace -w /workpace databricks-terraform apply
```

## Testing

* [ ] Integration tests should be run at a client level against both azure and aws to maintain sdk parity against both apis **(currently only on one cloud)**
* [x] Terraform acceptance tests should be run against both aws and azure to maintain parity of provider between both cloud services **(currently only on one cloud)**

## Code conventions

* Import statements should all be first ordered by "GoLang internal", "Vendor packages" and then "current provider packages". Within those sections imports must follow alphabetical order.

## Linting

Please use makefile for linting. If you run `golangci-lint` by itself it will fail due to different tags containing same functions. 
So please run `make lint` instead.

## Unit testing resources

In order to unit test a resource, which runs fast and could be included in code coverage, one should use `ResourceTester`, that launches embedded HTTP server with `HTTPFixture`'s containing all calls that should have been made in given scenario. Some may argue that this is not a pure unit test, because it creates a side effect in form of embedded server, though it's always on different random port, making it possible to execute these tests in parallel. Therefore comments about non-pure unit tests will be ignored, if they use `ResourceTester` helper.

```go
func TestPermissionsCreate(t *testing.T) {
	_, err := ResourceTester(t, []HTTPFixture{
		{
            Method:   http.MethodPatch,
            // requires full URI
            Resource: "/api/2.0/preview/permissions/clusters/abc",
            // works with entities, not JSON. Diff is displayed in case of missmatch 
			ExpectedRequest: model.AccessControlChangeList{
				AccessControlList: []*model.AccessControlChange{
					{
						UserName:        &TestingUser,
						PermissionLevel: "CAN_USE",
					},
				},
			},
		},
		{
			Method:   http.MethodGet,
			Resource: "/api/2.0/preview/permissions/clusters/abc?",
			Response: model.AccessControlChangeList{
				AccessControlList: []*model.AccessControlChange{
					{
						UserName:        &TestingUser,
						PermissionLevel: "CAN_MANAGE",
					},
				},
			},
		},
		{
			Method:   http.MethodGet,
			Resource: "/api/2.0/preview/scim/v2/Me?",
			Response: model.User{
				UserName: "chuck.norris",
			},
		},
    }, 
    // next argument is function, that creates resource (to make schema for ResourceData)
    resourcePermissions, 
    // state represented as native structure (though a bit clunky)
    map[string]interface{}{
		"cluster_id": "abc",
		"access_control": []interface{}{
			map[string]interface{}{
				"user_name":        TestingUser,
				"permission_level": "CAN_USE",
			},
		},
    },
    // the last argument is a function, that performs a stage on resource (Create/update/delete/read)
    resourcePermissionsCreate)
	assert.NoError(t, err, err)
}
```

Each resource should have both unit and integration tests. 

## Integration Testing

Currently Databricks supports two cloud providers `azure` and `aws` thus integration testing with the correct cloud service provider is 
crucial for making sure that the provider behaves as expected on all supported clouds. This type of testing separation is being managed via build tags 
to allow for duplicate method names and environment variables to configure clients. 

The current integration test implementation uses `CLOUD_ENV` environment variable and can use the value of `azure` or `aws`. 
You can execute the acceptance with the following make commands `make terraform-acc-azure`, and `make terraform-acc-aws` for 
azure and aws respectively. 

This involves bootstrapping the provider via a .env configuration file. Without these files in the root directory the tests 
will fail as the provider will not have a authorized token and host.

The configuration file for `aws` should be like the following and be named `.aws.env`:
```.env
DATABRICKS_HOST=<host>
DATABRICKS_TOKEN=<token>
```

The configuration file for `azure` should be like the following and be named `.azure.env`:
```.env
DATABRICKS_AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<enterprise app client id>
DATABRICKS_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=<enterprise app client secret>
DATABRICKS_AZURE_TENANT_ID=<azure ad tenant id>
DATABRICKS_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<azure subscription id>
DATABRICKS_AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP=<resource group where the workspace is>
AZURE_REGION=<region where the workspace is>
DATABRICKS_AZURE_MANAGED_RESOURCE_GROUP=<azure databricks managed resource group for workspace>
DATABRICKS_AZURE_WORKSPACE_NAME=<azure databricks workspace name>
```

Note that azure integration tests will use service principal based auth. Even though it is using a service principal, 
it will still be generating a personal access token to perform creation of resources.
