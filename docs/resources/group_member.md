# databricks_group_member Resource

This resource allows you to attach [users](user.md), [service_principal](service_principal.md), and [groups](group.md) as group members.

To attach members to groups in the Databricks account, the provider must be configured with `host = "https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com"` on AWS deployments or `host = "https://accounts.azuredatabricks.net"` and authenticate using [AAD tokens](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/databricks/databricks/latest/docs#special-configurations-for-azure) on Azure deployments

## Example Usage

After the following example, Bradley would have direct membership in group B and transitive membership in group A.

```hcl
resource "databricks_group" "a" {
  display_name = "A"
}

resource "databricks_group" "b" {
  display_name = "B"
}

resource "databricks_group_member" "ab" {
  group_id  = databricks_group.a.id
  member_id = databricks_group.b.id
}

resource "databricks_user" "bradley" {
  user_name = "bradley@example.com"
}

resource "databricks_group_member" "bb" {
  group_id  = databricks_group.b.id
  member_id = databricks_user.bradley.id
}
```
