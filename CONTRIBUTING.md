## Installing for Terraform 0.12

If you use Terraform 0.12, please execute the following curl command in your shell:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databricks/databricks-terraform/master/godownloader-databricks-provider.sh | bash -s -- -b $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins
```

## Installing from source

On MacOS X, you can install GoLang through `brew install go`, on Debian-based Linux, you can install it by `sudo apt-get install golang -y`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks.git
cd terraform-provider-databricks
make install
```

Most likely, `terraform init -upgrade -verify-plugins=false -lock=false` would be a very great command to use.

## Contributing documentation

All documentation contributions should be as detailed as possible and follow the [required format](https://www.terraform.io/registry/providers/docs). The following additional checks must also be valid:

* `make fmt-docs` to make sure code examples are consistent
* Correct rendering with Terraform Registry Doc Preview Tool - https://registry.terraform.io/tools/doc-preview
* Cross-linking integrity between markdown files. Pay special attention, when resource doc refers to data doc or guide.

## Developing provider

In order to simplify development workflow, you should use [dev_overrides](https://www.terraform.io/cli/config/config-file#development-overrides-for-provider-developers) section in your `~/.terraformrc` file. Please run `make build` and replace "provider-binary" with the path to `terraform-provider-databricks` executable in your current working directory:

```
$ cat ~/.terraformrc
provider_installation {
   dev_overrides {
     "databricks/databricks" = "provider-binary"
   }
   direct {}
}
```

After installing necessary software for building provider from sources, you should install `staticcheck` and `gotestsum` in order to run `make test`.

Make sure you have `$GOPATH/bin` in your `$PATH`:
```
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin" >> ~/.bash_profile
```

Installing `staticcheck` (the version that works with Go 1.18):
```bash
go install honnef.co/go/tools/cmd/staticcheck@v0.3.2
```

Installing `gotestsum`:
```bash
go get gotest.tools/gotestsum
```

Installing `goimports`:
```bash
go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
```

After this, you should be able to run `make coverage` to run the tests and see the coverage.

## Debugging

**TF_LOG_PROVIDER=DEBUG terraform apply** allows you to see the internal logs from `terraform apply`.

You can [run provider in a debug mode](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/debugging#running-terraform-with-a-provider-in-debug-mode) from VScode IDE by launching `Debug Provider` run configuration and invoking `terraform apply` with `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` environment variable.

## Adding a new resource

The general process for adding a new resource is:

*Define the resource models.* The models for a resource are `struct`s defining the schemas of the objects in the Databricks REST API. Define structures used for multiple resources in a common `models.go` file; otherwise, you can define these directly in your resource file. An example model:
```go
type Field struct {
 A string `json:"a,omitempty"`
 AMoreComplicatedName int `json:"a_more_complicated_name,omitempty"`
}

type Example struct {
 ID string `json:"id"`
 TheField *Field `json:"the_field"`
 AnotherField bool `json:"another_field"`
 Filters []string `json:"filters" tf:"optional"`
}
```

Some interesting points to note here:
* Use the `json` tag to determine the serde properties of the field. The allowed tags are defined here: https://go.googlesource.com/go/+/go1.16/src/encoding/json/encode.go#158
* Use the custom `tf` tag indicates properties to be annotated on the Terraform schema for this struct. Supported values are:
  * `optional` for optional fields
  * `computed` for computed fields
  * `alias:X` to use a custom name in HCL for a field
  * `default:X` to set a default value for a field
  * `max_items:N` to set the maximum number of items for a multi-valued parameter
  * `slice_set` to indicate that a the parameter should accept a set instead of a list
 * Do not use bare references to structs in the model; rather, use pointers to structs. Maps and slices are permitted, as well as the following primitive types: int, int32, int64, float64, bool, string.
See `typeToSchema` in `common/reflect_resource.go` for the up-to-date list of all supported field types and values for the `tf` tag.

*Define the Terraform schema.* This is made easy for you by the `StructToSchema` method in the `common` package, which converts your struct automatically to a Terraform schema, accepting also a function allowing the user to post-process the automatically generated schema, if needed.
```go
var exampleSchema = common.StructToSchema(Example{}, func(m map[string]*schema.Schema) map[string]*schema.Schema { return m })
```

*Define the API client for the resource.* You will need to implement create, read, update, and delete functions.
```go
type ExampleApi struct {
	client *common.DatabricksClient
	ctx    context.Context
}

func NewExampleApi(ctx context.Context, m interface{}) ExampleApi {
	return ExampleApi{m.(*common.DatabricksClient), ctx}
}

func (a ExampleApi) Create(e Example) (string, error) {
	var id string
	err := a.client.Post(a.ctx, "/example", e, &id)
	return id, err
}

func (a ExampleApi) Read(id string) (e Example, err error) {
	err = a.client.Get(a.ctx, "/example/"+id, nil, &e)
	return
}

func (a ExampleApi) Update(id string, e Example) error {
	return a.client.Put(a.ctx, "/example/"+string(id), e)
}

func (a ExampleApi) Delete(id string) error {
	return a.client.Delete(a.ctx, "/pipelines/"+id, nil)
}
```

*Define the Resource object itself.* This is made quite simple by using the `toResource` function defined on the `Resource` type in the `common` package. A simple example:
```go
func ResourceExample() *schema.Resource {
	return common.Resource{
		Schema: exampleSchema,
		Create: func(ctx context.Context, d *schema.ResourceData, c *common.DatabricksClient) error {
			var e Example
			common.DataToStructPointer(d, exampleSchema, &e)
			id, err := NewExampleApi(ctx, c).Create(e)
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}
			d.SetId(string(id))
			return nil
		},
		Read: func(ctx context.Context, d *schema.ResourceData, c *common.DatabricksClient) error {
			i, err := NewExampleApi(ctx, c).Read(d.Id())
			if err != nil {
				return err
			}
			return common.StructToData(i.Spec, exampleSchema, d)
		},
		Update: func(ctx context.Context, d *schema.ResourceData, c *common.DatabricksClient) error {
			var e Example
			common.DataToStructPointer(d, exampleSchema, &e)
			return NewExampleApi(ctx, c).Update(d.Id(), e)
		},
		Delete: func(ctx context.Context, d *schema.ResourceData, c *common.DatabricksClient) error {
			return NewExampleApi(ctx, c).Delete(d.Id())
		},
	}.ToResource()
}
```

*Add the resource to the top-level provider.* Simply add the resource to the provider definition in `provider/provider.go`.

*Write unit tests for your resource.* To write your unit tests, you can make use of `ResourceFixture` and `HTTPFixture` structs defined in the `qa` package. This starts a fake HTTP server, asserting that your resource provdier generates the correct request for a given HCL template body for your resource. Update tests should have `InstanceState` field in order to test various corner-cases, like `ForceNew` schemas. It's possible to expect fixture to require new resource by specifying `RequiresNew` field. With the help of `qa.ResourceCornerCases` and `qa.ResourceFixture` one can achieve 100% code coverage for all of the new code.

A simple example:

```go
func TestExampleCornerCases(t *testing.T) {
	qa.ResourceCornerCases(t, ResourceExample())
}

func TestExampleResourceCreate(t *testing.T) {
	qa.ResourceFixture{
		Fixtures: []qa.HTTPFixture{
			{
				Method:          "POST",
				Resource:        "/api/2.0/example",
				ExpectedRequest: Example{
					TheField: Field{
						A: "test",
					},
				},
				Response: map[string]interface{} {
					"id": "abcd",
					"the_field": map[string]interface{} {
						"a": "test",
					},
				},
			},
			{
				Method:   "GET",
				Resource: "/api/2.0/example/abcd",
				Response: map[string]interface{}{
					"id":    "abcd",
					"the_field": map[string]interface{} {
						"a": "test",
					},
				},
			},
		},
		Create:   true,
		Resource: ResourceExample(),
		HCL: `the_field {
			a = "test"
		}`,
	}.ApplyNoError(t)
}
```

*Write acceptance tests.* These are E2E tests which run terraform against the live cloud and Databricks APIs. For these, you can use the `Test` and `Step` structs defined in the `acceptance` package. An example:

```go
func TestPreviewAccPipelineResource_CreatePipeline(t *testing.T) {
	acceptance.Test(t, []acceptance.Step{
		{
			Template: `
			resource "databricks_example" "this" {
				the_field {
					a = "test"
					a_more_complicated_name = 3
				}
				another_field = true
				filters = [
					"a",
					"b"
				]
			}
			`,
		},
	})
}
```

## Testing

* [Integration tests](scripts/README.md) should be run at a client level against both azure and aws to maintain sdk parity against both apis.
* Terraform acceptance tests should be run against both aws and azure to maintain parity of provider between both cloud services
* Consider test functions as scenarios, that you are debugging from IDE when specific issues arise. Test tables are discouraged. Single-use functions in tests are discouraged, unless resource definitions they make are longer than 80 lines.
* All tests should be capable of repeatedly running on "dirty" environment, which means not requiring a new clean environment every time the test runs.
* All tests should re-use compute resources whenever possible.
* Prefer `require.NoError` (stops the test on error) to `assert.NoError` (continues the test on error) when checking the results.

## Code conventions

* Files should not be larger than 600 lines
* Single function should fit to be seen on 13" screen: no more than 40 lines of code. Only exception to this rule is `*_test.go` files. 
* There should be no unnecessary package exports: no structs & types with leading capital letter, unless they are of value outside of the package.
* `fmt.Sprintf` with more than 4 placeholders is considered too complex to maintain. Should be avoided at all cost. Use `qa.EnvironmentTemplate(t, "This is {env.DATABRICKS_HOST} with {var.RANDOM} name.")` instead
* Import statements should all be first ordered by "GoLang internal", "Vendor packages" and then "current provider packages". Within those sections imports must follow alphabetical order.

## Linting

Please use makefile for linting. If you run `staticcheck` by itself it will fail due to different tags containing same functions. 
So please run `make lint` instead.

## Developing with Visual Studio Code Devcontainers

This project has configuration for working with [Visual Studio Code Devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) - this allows you to containerise your development prerequisites (e.g. golang, terraform). To use this you will need [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

To get started, clone this repo and open the folder with Visual Studio Code. If you don't have the [Remote Development extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) then you should be prompted to install it.

Once the folder is loaded and the extension is installed you should be prompted to re-open the folder in a devcontainer. This will built and run the container image with the correct tools (and versions) ready to start working on and building the code. The in-built terminal will launch a shell inside the container for running `make` commands etc.

See the docs for more details on working with [devcontainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).
