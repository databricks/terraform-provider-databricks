Endpoints datasource retrieves a list of all network connectivity endpoints for private access to Databricks workspaces.

-> **Note** This resource can only be used with an account-level provider!


## Example Usage
### Example for Azure cloud
This is an example for listing endpoints in Azure cloud:
```hcl
data "databricks_endpoints" "all" {
  account_id = "eae3abf6-1496-494e-9983-4660a5ad5aab"
}
```


## Arguments
The following arguments are supported:
* `parent` (string, required)
* `page_size` (integer, optional)


## Attributes
This data source exports a single attribute, `items`. It is a list of resources, each with the following attributes:
* `account_id` (string) - The Databricks Account in which the endpoint object exists
* `azure_private_endpoint_info` (AzurePrivateEndpointInfo) - Info for an Azure private endpoint
* `create_time` (string) - The timestamp when the endpoint was created. The timestamp is in RFC 3339 format in UTC timezone
* `display_name` (string) - The human-readable display name of this endpoint.
  The input should conform to RFC-1034, which restricts to letters, numbers, and hyphens,
  with the first character a letter, the last a letter or a number, and a 63 character maximum
* `endpoint_id` (string) - The unique identifier for this endpoint under the account. This field is a UUID generated by Databricks
* `name` (string) - The resource name of the endpoint, which uniquely identifies the endpoint
* `region` (string) - The cloud provider region where this endpoint is located
* `state` (string) - The state of the endpoint. The endpoint can only be used if the state is `APPROVED`. Possible values are: `APPROVED`, `DISCONNECTED`, `FAILED`, `PENDING`
* `use_case` (string) - The use case that determines the type of network connectivity this endpoint provides.
  This field is automatically determined based on the endpoint configuration and cloud-specific settings. Possible values are: `SERVICE_DIRECT`

### AzurePrivateEndpointInfo
* `private_endpoint_name` (string) - The name of the Private Endpoint in the Azure subscription
* `private_endpoint_resource_guid` (string) - The GUID of the Private Endpoint resource in the Azure subscription.
  This is assigned by Azure when the user sets up the Private Endpoint
* `private_endpoint_resource_id` (string) - The full resource ID of the Private Endpoint
* `private_link_service_id` (string) - The resource ID of the Databricks Private Link Service that this Private Endpoint connects to
