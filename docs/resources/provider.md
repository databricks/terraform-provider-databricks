# databricks_provider Resource

Within a metastore, Unity Catalog provides the ability to create a provider which contains a list of shares that have been shared with you.

A `databricks_provider` is contained within [databricks_metastore](metastore.md) and can contain a list of shares that have been shared with you.

Note that Databricks to Databricks sharing automatically creates the provider.

  authentication_type = "TOKEN"
  recipient_profile_str = jsonencode(
    {
      "shareCredentialsVersion" : 1,
      "bearerToken" : "token",
      "endpoint" : "endpoint",
