# databricks_job Resource

The `databricks_job` resource allows you to manage [Databricks Jobs](https://docs.databricks.com/jobs.html) to run non-interactive code in a [databricks_cluster](cluster.md).

## Example Usage

-> **Note** In Terraform configuration, it is recommended to define tasks in alphabetical order of their `task_key` arguments, so that you get consistent and readable diff. Whenever tasks are added or removed, or `task_key` is renamed, you'll observe a change in the majority of tasks. It's related to the fact that the current version of the provider treats `task` blocks as an ordered list. Alternatively, `task` block could have been an unordered set, though end-users would see the entire block replaced upon a change in single property of the task.

It is possible to create [a Databricks job](https://docs.databricks.com/data-engineering/jobs/jobs-user-guide.html) using `task` blocks. Single task is defined with the `task` block containing one of the `*_task` block, `task_key`, `libraries`, `email_notifications`, `timeout_seconds`, `max_retries`, `min_retry_interval_millis`, `retry_on_timeout` attributes and `depends_on` blocks to define cross-task dependencies.

```hcl
resource "databricks_job" "this" {
  name = "Job with multiple tasks"

  job_cluster {
    job_cluster_key = "j"
    new_cluster {
      num_workers   = 2
      spark_version = data.databricks_spark_version.latest.id
      node_type_id  = data.databricks_node_type.smallest.id
    }
  }

  task {
    task_key = "a"

    new_cluster {
      num_workers   = 1
      spark_version = data.databricks_spark_version.latest.id
      node_type_id  = data.databricks_node_type.smallest.id
    }

    notebook_task {
      notebook_path = databricks_notebook.this.path
    }
  }

  task {
    task_key = "b"
    //this task will only run after task a
    depends_on {
      task_key = "a"
    }

    existing_cluster_id = databricks_cluster.shared.id

    spark_jar_task {
      main_class_name = "com.acme.data.Main"
    }
  }

  task {
    task_key = "c"

    job_cluster_key = "j"

    notebook_task {
      notebook_path = databricks_notebook.this.path
    }
  }
  //this task starts a Delta Live Tables pipline update
  task {
    task_key = "d"

    pipeline_task {
      pipeline_id = databricks_pipeline.this.id
    }
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The resource supports the following arguments:

* `name` - (Optional) An optional name for the job. The default value is Untitled.
* `job_cluster` - (Optional) A list of job [databricks_cluster](cluster.md) specifications that can be shared and reused by tasks of this job. Libraries cannot be declared in a shared job cluster. You must declare dependent libraries in task settings. *Multi-task syntax*
* `always_running` - (Optional, Deprecated) (Bool) Whenever the job is always running, like a Spark Streaming application, on every update restart the current active run or start it again, if nothing it is not running. False by default. Any job runs are started with `parameters` specified in `spark_jar_task` or `spark_submit_task` or `spark_python_task` or `notebook_task` blocks.
* `control_run_state` - (Optional) (Bool) If true, the Databricks provider will stop and start the job as needed to ensure that the active run for the job reflects the deployed configuration. For continuous jobs, the provider respects the `pause_status` by stopping the current active run. This flag cannot be set for non-continuous jobs.

  When migrating from `always_running` to `control_run_state`, set `continuous` as follows:
  ```
  continuous { }
  ```
* `library` - (Optional) (Set) An optional list of libraries to be installed on the cluster that will execute the job. Please consult [libraries section](cluster.md#libraries) for [databricks_cluster](cluster.md) resource.
* `retry_on_timeout` - (Optional) (Bool) An optional policy to specify whether to retry a job when it times out. The default behavior is to not retry on timeout.
* `max_retries` - (Optional) (Integer) An optional maximum number of times to retry an unsuccessful run. A run is considered to be unsuccessful if it completes with a FAILED or INTERNAL_ERROR lifecycle state. The value -1 means to retry indefinitely and the value 0 means to never retry. The default behavior is to never retry. A run can have the following lifecycle state: PENDING, RUNNING, TERMINATING, TERMINATED, SKIPPED or INTERNAL_ERROR
* `timeout_seconds` - (Optional) (Integer) An optional timeout applied to each run of this job. The default behavior is to have no timeout.
* `min_retry_interval_millis` - (Optional) (Integer) An optional minimal interval in milliseconds between the start of the failed run and the subsequent retry run. The default behavior is that unsuccessful runs are immediately retried.
* `max_concurrent_runs` - (Optional) (Integer) An optional maximum allowed number of concurrent runs of the job. Defaults to *1*.
* `email_notifications` - (Optional) (List) An optional set of email addresses notified when runs of this job begins, completes and fails. The default behavior is to not send any emails. This field is a block and is documented below.
* `webhook_notifications` - (Optional) (List) An optional set of system destinations (for example, webhook destinations or Slack) to be notified when runs of this job begins, completes and fails. The default behavior is to not send any notifications. This field is a block and is documented below.
* `schedule` - (Optional) (List) An optional periodic schedule for this job. The default behavior is that the job runs when triggered by clicking Run Now in the Jobs UI or sending an API request to runNow. This field is a block and is documented below.

### tags Configuration Map
`tags` - (Optional) (Map) An optional map of the tags associated with the job. Specified tags will be used as cluster tags for job clusters.

```

### run_as Configuration Block

The `run_as` block allows specifying the user or the service principal that the job runs as. If not specified, the job runs as the user or service
principal that created the job.

* `user_name` - (Optional) The email of an active workspace user. Non-admin users can only set this field to their own email.
* `service_principal_name` - (Optional) The application ID of an active service principal. Setting this field requires the `servicePrincipal/user` role.

### spark_submit_task Configuration Block

You can invoke Spark submit tasks only on new clusters. **In the `new_cluster` specification, `libraries` and `spark_conf` are not supported**. Instead, use --jars and --py-files to add Java and Python libraries and `--conf` to set the Spark configuration. By default, the Spark submit job uses all available memory (excluding reserved memory for Databricks services). You can set `--driver-memory`, and `--executor-memory` to a smaller value to leave some room for off-heap usage. **Please use `spark_jar_task`, `spark_python_task` or `notebook_task` wherever possible**.

* `parameters` - (Optional) (List) Command-line parameters passed to spark submit.

### spark_python_task Configuration Block

* `python_file` - (Required) The URI of the Python file to be executed. [databricks_dbfs_file](dbfs_file.md#path), cloud file URIs (e.g. `s3:/`, `abfss:/`, `gs:/`), workspace paths and remote repository are supported. For Python files stored in the Databricks workspace, the path must be absolute and begin with `/Repos`. For files stored in a remote repository, the path must be relative. This field is required.
* `source` - (Optional) Location type of the Python file, can only be `GIT`. When set to `GIT`, the Python file will be retrieved from a Git repository defined in `git_source`.
* `parameters` - (Optional) (List) Command line parameters passed to the Python file.

### notebook_task Configuration Block

* `notebook_path` - (Required) The path of the [databricks_notebook](notebook.md#path) to be run in the Databricks workspace or remote repository. For notebooks stored in the Databricks workspace, the path must be absolute and begin with a slash. For notebooks stored in a remote repository, the path must be relative. This field is required.
* `source` - (Optional) Location type of the notebook, can only be `WORKSPACE` or `GIT`. When set to `WORKSPACE`, the notebook will be retrieved from the local Databricks workspace. When set to `GIT`, the notebook will be retrieved from a Git repository defined in `git_source`. If the value is empty, the task will use `GIT` if `git_source` is defined and `WORKSPACE` otherwise.
* `base_parameters` - (Optional) (Map) Base parameters to be used for each run of this job. If the run is initiated by a call to run-now with parameters specified, the two parameters maps will be merged. If the same key is specified in base_parameters and in run-now, the value from run-now will be used. If the notebook takes a parameter that is not specified in the job’s base_parameters or the run-now override parameters, the default value from the notebook will be used. Retrieve these parameters in a notebook using `dbutils.widgets.get`.

  name = "Example SQL Job"
  task {
    task_key = "run_agg_query"
    sql_task {
      warehouse_id = databricks_sql_endpoint.sql_job_warehouse.id
      query {
        query_id = databricks_sql_query.agg_query.id

        }
      }
    }
  }
  task {
    task_key = "run_alert"
    sql_task {
      warehouse_id = databricks_sql_endpoint.sql_job_warehouse.id
      alert {
        alert_id = databricks_sql_alert.alert.id
        subscriptions {
          user_name = "user@domain.com"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Exported attributes

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the job
* `url` - URL of the job on the given workspace

## Access Control

By default, all users can create and modify jobs unless an administrator [enables jobs access control](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/access-control/jobs-acl.html). With jobs access control, individual permissions determine a user’s abilities.

* [databricks_permissions](permissions.md#Job-usage) can control which groups or individual users can *Can View*, *Can Manage Run*, and *Can Manage*.
* [databricks_cluster_policy](cluster_policy.md) can control which kinds of clusters users can create for jobs.

## Single-task syntax (legacy)

This syntax uses Jobs API 2.0 to create a job with a single task. Only a subset of arguments above is supported (`name`, `libraries`, `email_notifications`, `webhook_notifications`, `timeout_seconds`, `max_retries`, `min_retry_interval_millis`, `retry_on_timeout`, `schedule`, `max_concurrent_runs`), and only a single block of `notebook_task`, `spark_jar_task`, `spark_python_task`, `spark_submit_task` and `pipeline_task` can be specified.

The job cluster is specified using either of the below argument:

* `new_cluster` - (Optional) Same set of parameters as for [databricks_cluster](cluster.md) resource.
* `existing_cluster_id` - (Optional) If existing_cluster_id, the ID of an existing [cluster](cluster.md) that will be used for all runs of this job. When running jobs on an existing cluster, you may need to manually restart the cluster if it stops responding. We strongly suggest to use `new_cluster` for greater reliability.

```hcl
data "databricks_current_user" "me" {}
data "databricks_spark_version" "latest" {}
data "databricks_node_type" "smallest" {
  local_disk = true
}

resource "databricks_notebook" "this" {
  path     = "${data.databricks_current_user.me.home}/Terraform"
  language = "PYTHON"
  content_base64 = base64encode(<<-EOT
    # created from ${abspath(path.module)}
    display(spark.range(10))
    EOT
  )
}

resource "databricks_job" "this" {
  name = "Terraform Demo (${data.databricks_current_user.me.alphanumeric})"

  new_cluster {
    num_workers   = 1
    spark_version = data.databricks_spark_version.latest.id
    node_type_id  = data.databricks_node_type.smallest.id
  }

  notebook_task {
    notebook_path = databricks_notebook.this.path
  }
}

output "notebook_url" {
  value = databricks_notebook.this.url
}

output "job_url" {
  value = databricks_job.this.url
}
```

## Timeouts

The `timeouts` block allows you to specify `create` and `update` timeouts if you have an `always_running` job. Please launch `TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply` whenever you observe timeout issues.

```hcl
timeouts {
  create = "20m"
  update = "20m"
}
```

## Import

The resource job can be imported using the id of the job

```bash
terraform import databricks_job.this <job-id>
```
