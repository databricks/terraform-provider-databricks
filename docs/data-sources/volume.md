# databricks_volume Data Source

Retrieves details about [databricks_volume](../resources/volume.md) that was created by Terraform or manually. 
A volume can be identified by its three-level (fully qualified) name (in the form of: `catalog_name`.`schema_name`.`volume_name`) as input. This can be retrieved programmatically using [databricks_volumes](../data-sources/volumes.md) data source.

## Example Usage

* Retrieve details of all volumes in in a _things_ [databricks_schema](../resources/schema.md) of a  _sandbox_ [databricks_catalog](../resources/catalog.md):

```hcl
data "databricks_volumes" "all" {
  catalog_name = "sandbox"
  schema_name  = "things"
}

data "databricks_volume" {
  for_each = data.datatbricks_volumes.all.ids
  name     = each.value
}
```

* Search for a specific volume by its fully qualified name

```hcl
data "databricks_volume" "this" {
  name = "catalog.schema.volume"
}
```
