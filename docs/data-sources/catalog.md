# databricks_catalog Data Source

-> **Note** This data source can only be used with a workspace-level provider!

-> **Note** If you have a fully automated setup with workspaces created by [databricks_mws_workspaces](../resources/mws_workspaces.md) or [azurerm_databricks_workspace](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/databricks_workspace), please make sure to add [depends_on attribute](../guides/troubleshooting.md#data-resources-and-authentication-is-not-configured-errors) in order to prevent _default auth: cannot configure default credentials_ errors.

Retrieves details of a specific catalog in Unity Catalog, that were created by Terraform or manually. Use [databricks_catalogs](catalogs.md) to retrieve IDs of multiple catalogs from Unity Catalog

## Example Usage

Read  on a specific catalog `test`:

```hcl
data "databricks_catalog" "test" {
  name = "test"
}
resource "databricks_grants" "things" {
  catalog = data.databricks_catalog.test.name
  grant {
    principal  = "sensitive"
    privileges = ["USE_CATALOG"]
  }
}
```
