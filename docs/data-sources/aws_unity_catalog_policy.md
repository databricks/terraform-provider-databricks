# databricks_aws_unity_catalog_policy Data Source

-> **Note** This resource has an evolving API, which may change in future versions of the provider. Please always consult [latest documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/data-governance/unity-catalog/get-started.html#configure-a-storage-bucket-and-iam-role-in-aws) in case of any questions.

This data source constructs the necessary AWS Unity Catalog policy for you.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "databricks_aws_unity_catalog_policy" "this" {
  aws_account_id = var.aws_account_id
  bucket_name    = "databricks-bucket"
  role_name      = "${var.prefix}-uc-access"
  kms_name       = "arn:aws:kms:us-west-2:111122223333:key/databricks-kms"
}

data "databricks_aws_unity_catalog_assume_role_policy" "this" {
  aws_account_id = var.aws_account_id
  role_name      = "${var.prefix}-uc-access"
  external_id    = "12345"
}

resource "aws_iam_policy" "unity_metastore" {
  name   = "${var.prefix}-unity-catalog-metastore-access-iam-policy"
  policy = data.databricks_aws_unity_catalog_policy.this.json
}

resource "aws_iam_role" "metastore_data_access" {
  name                = "${var.prefix}-uc-access"
  assume_role_policy  = data.aws_iam_policy_document.this.json
  managed_policy_arns = [aws_iam_policy.unity_metastore.arn]
}
```
