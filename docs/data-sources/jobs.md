# databricks_jobs Data Source

-> **Note** If you have a fully automated setup with workspaces created by [databricks_mws_workspaces](../resources/mws_workspaces.md) or [azurerm_databricks_workspace](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs/resources/databricks_workspace), please make sure to add [depends_on attribute](../guides/troubleshooting.md#data-resources-and-authentication-is-not-configured-errors) in order to prevent _default auth: cannot configure default credentials_ errors.

Retrieves a list of [databricks_job](../resources/job.md) ids, that were created by Terraform or manually, so that special handling could be applied.

-> **Note** Data resource will error in case of jobs with duplicate names.

## Example Usage

Granting view [databricks_permissions](../resources/permissions.md) to all [databricks_job](../resources/job.md) within the workspace:

```hcl
data "databricks_jobs" "this" {}

resource "databricks_permissions" "everyone_can_view_all_jobs" {
  for_each = data.databricks_jobs.this.ids
  job_id   = each.value

  access_control {
    group_name       = "users"
    permission_level = "CAN_VIEW"
  }
}
```

Getting ID of specific [databricks_job](../resources/job.md) by name:

```hcl
data "databricks_jobs" "this" {}

output "x" {
  value     = "ID of `x` job is ${data.databricks_jobs.this.ids["x"]}"
  sensitive = false
}
```
