/*
These generated types are for terraform plugin framework to interact with the terraform state conveniently.

These types follow the same structure as the types in go-sdk.
The only difference is that the primitive types are no longer using the go-native types, but with tfsdk types.
Plus the json tags get converted into tfsdk tags.
We use go-native types for lists and maps intentionally for the ease for converting these types into the go-sdk types.
