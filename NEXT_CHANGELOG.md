# NEXT CHANGELOG

## Release v1.143.0

### Important Changes

* `databricks_app` now updates apps through the asynchronous Apps update API ([#6151](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6151)).
  The synchronous update API ignored `compute_size`, `compute_min_instances`, and
  `compute_max_instances`, so changes to them never took effect; they are now applied. As
  before, an update replaces the app's updatable fields with the configuration, so fields
  omitted from it are cleared. That now also covers the fields the synchronous API skipped: an
  omitted `compute_size` resets to `MEDIUM`, omitted `compute_min_instances` and
  `compute_max_instances` disable horizontal scaling, and an omitted `git_source` clears the
  app's default git source. Updates now wait for the app update to reach `SUCCEEDED`.

### Breaking Changes

### New Features and Improvements
* Add resource and data sources for `databricks_assume_group_restricted_sharing_group`.
* Add `personal_access_token_wo` and `personal_access_token_wo_version` write-only attributes to `databricks_git_credential` resource ([#6088](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6088)).
* Add `options_wo` and `options_wo_version` write-only attributes to `databricks_connection` resource ([#6088](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6088)).

* Added `databricks_user_by_external_id`, `databricks_group_by_external_id`, and `databricks_service_principal_by_external_id` data sources to resolve principals by the external ID assigned to them by the customer's Identity Provider ([#5932](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/5932)).

  These data sources work with both the account-level and workspace-level provider. They call the Databricks `resolve-by-external-id` APIs, which create the principal in the account if one with the given `external_id` does not already exist, and require the account to be onboarded to Automatic Identity Management (AIM).

### Bug Fixes
* Keep the configured values of the `pem_key_passphrase`, `ssl_keystore_key`, `ssl_key_password` and `schema_registry_api_secret` options of `databricks_connection`, which the API doesn't return, to avoid a perpetual diff ([#6088](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6088)).
* Ignore whitespace-only differences in PEM-encoded options of `databricks_connection`, such as `userProvidedServerCertificate`, to avoid a perpetual diff ([#6088](https://github.com/databricks/terraform-provider-databricks/pull/6088)).
