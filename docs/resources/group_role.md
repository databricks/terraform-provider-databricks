# databricks_group_role Resource

This resource allows you to attach a role to [databricks_group](group.md). This role could be a pre-defined role such as account admin, or an instance profile ARN.

## Example Usage

Attach an instance profile to a group

```hcl
resource "databricks_instance_profile" "instance_profile" {
  instance_profile_arn = "my_instance_profile_arn"
}

resource "databricks_group" "my_group" {
  display_name = "my_group_name"
}

resource "databricks_group_role" "my_group_instance_profile" {
  group_id = databricks_group.my_group.id
  role     = databricks_instance_profile.instance_profile.id
}
```

Attach account admin role to an account-level group

```hcl
provider "databricks" {
  host          = "https://accounts.cloud.databricks.com"
  account_id    = var.databricks_account_id
  client_id     = var.client_id
  client_secret = var.client_secret
}

resource "databricks_group" "my_group" {
  display_name = "my_group_name"
}

resource "databricks_group_role" "my_group_account_admin" {
  group_id = databricks_group.my_group.id
  role     = "account_admin"
}
```
