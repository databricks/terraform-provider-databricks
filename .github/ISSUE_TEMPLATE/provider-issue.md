Hi there,

Thank you for opening an issue. Please note that we try to keep the Databricks Provider issue tracker reserved for bug reports and feature requests. For general usage questions, please see: https://www.terraform.io/community.html.

### Configuration
```hcl
# Copy-paste your Terraform configuration here
```

### Expected Behavior
What should have happened?

### Actual Behavior
What actually happened?

### Steps to Reproduce
Please list the steps required to reproduce the issue, for example:
1. `terraform apply`

### Terraform and provider versions

Please paste the output of `terraform version`. If version of `databricks` provider is not the latest (https://github.com/databrickslabs/terraform-provider-databricks/releases), please make sure to use the latest one.

### Debug Output
Please add turn on logging, e.g. `TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply` and run command again, paste it to gist & provide the link to gist. If you're still willing to paste in log output, make sure you provide only relevant log lines with requests.

It would make it more readable, if you pipe the log through `| grep databricks | sed -E 's/^.* plugin[^:]+: (.*)$/\1/'`, e.g.:

```
TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform plan 2>&1 | grep databricks | sed -E 's/^.* plugin[^:]+: (.*)$/\1/'
```

If Terraform produced a panic, please provide a link to a GitHub Gist containing the output of the `crash.log`.

### Important Factoids
Are there anything atypical about your accounts that we should know?
