      name = "creator.default.myasset"
      asset_type = "TABLE"
      table_local_details = {
          local_name = "some_creator.default.myasset"
      }
}
```

## Import
As of Terraform v1.5, resources can be imported through configuration.
```hcl
import {
  id = clean_room_name,name,asset_type
  to = databricks_clean_room_asset.this
}
```

If you are using an older version of Terraform, import the resource using the `terraform import` command as follows:
```sh
terraform import databricks_clean_room_asset clean_room_name,name,asset_type
```
