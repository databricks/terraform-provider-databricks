# databricks_azure_blob_mount Resource

**This resource has evolving API, which may change in future versions of provider.**

This resource will mount your Azure Blob Storage bucket on `dbfs:/mnt/yourname`. It is important to understand that this will start up the cluster if the cluster is terminated. The read and refresh terraform command will require a cluster and make take some time to validate mount. If cluster_id is not specified, it will create the smallest possible cluster called `terraform-mount` for shortest possible amount of time. This resource will help you create, get and delete a azure blob storage mount using SAS token or storage account access keys.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "azurerm_storage_account" "blobaccount" {
  name                     = "${var.prefix}blob"
  resource_group_name      = var.resource_group_name
  location                 = var.resource_group_location
  account_tier             = "Standard"
  account_replication_type = "LRS"
  account_kind             = "StorageV2"
}

resource "azurerm_storage_container" "marketing" {
  name                  = "marketing"
  storage_account_name  = azurerm_storage_account.blobaccount.name
  container_access_type = "private"
}

resource "databricks_secret_scope" "terraform" {
    name                     = "application"
    initial_manage_principal = "users"
}

resource "databricks_secret" "storage_key" {
    key          = "blob_storage_key"
    string_value = azurerm_storage_account.blobaccount.primary_access_key
    scope        = databricks_secret_scope.terraform.name
}

resource "databricks_azure_blob_mount" "marketing" {
    container_name       = azurerm_storage_container.marketing.name
    storage_account_name = azurerm_storage_account.blobaccount.name
    mount_name           = "marketing"
    auth_type            = "ACCESS_KEY"
    token_secret_scope   = databricks_secret_scope.terraform.name
    token_secret_key     = databricks_secret.storage_key.key
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are required:

* `auth_type` - (Required) (String) This is the auth type for blob storage. This can either be SAS tokens or account access keys.
* `token_secret_scope` - (Required) (String) This is the secret scope in which your auth type token exists in.
* `token_secret_key` - (Required) (String) This is the secret key in which your auth type token exists in.
* `container_name` - (Required) (String) The container in which the data is. This is what you are trying to mount.
* `storage_account_name` - (Required) (String) The name of the storage resource in which the data is.
* `cluster_id` - (Optional) (String) Cluster to use for mounting. If no cluster is specified, new cluster will be created and will mount the bucket for all of the clusters in this workspace. If cluster is not running - it's going to be started, so be aware to set autotermination rules on it.
* `mount_name` - (Required) (String) Name, under which mount will be accessible in `dbfs:/mnt/<MOUNT_NAME>`.
* `directory` - (Computed) (String) This is optional if you want to add an additional directory that you wish to mount. This must start with a "/".

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - mount name
* `source` - (String) HDFS-compatible url `wasbs://<adlsv2-account>` 


## Import

The resource can be imported using it's mount name

```bash
$ terraform import databricks_azure_blob_mount.this <mount_name>
```
