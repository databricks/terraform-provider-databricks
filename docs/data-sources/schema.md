# databricks_schema Data Source

Retrieves details about [databricks_schema](../resources/schema.md) that was created by Terraform or manually. 
A schema can be identified by its two-level (fully qualified) name (in the form of: `catalog_name`.`schema_name`) as input. This can be retrieved programmatically using [databricks_schemas](../data-sources/schemas.md) data source.

## Example Usage

* Retrieve details of all schemas in in a _sandbox_ [databricks_catalog](../resources/catalog.md):

```hcl
data "databricks_schemas" "all" {
  catalog_name = "sandbox"
}

data "databricks_schema" "this" {
  for_each = data.databricks_schemas.all.ids
  name     = each.value
}
```

* Search for a specific schema by its fully qualified name:

```hcl
data "databricks_schema" "this" {
  name = "catalog.schema"
}
```
