// Package api contains API structures for use with the Databricks SQL API.
//
// These are not intended to be used directly.
//
// They are kept in a separate package to avoid confusion between the
// Terraform resources and the API objects. While their structure is
// very similar, there are a handful of nuanced differences to improve
// the UX of the Terraform resource.
