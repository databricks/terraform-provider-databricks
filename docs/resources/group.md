# databricks_group Resource

This resource allows you to create groups in Databricks. You can also [associate](group_member.md) Databricks users to groups. This is useful if you are using an application to sync users & groups with SCIM API.

Recommended to use along with Identity Provider SCIM provisioning to populate users into those groups:

* [Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/administration-guide/users-groups/scim/aad)
* [Okta](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/scim/okta.html)
* [OneLogin](https://docs.databricks.com/administration-guide/users-groups/scim/onelogin.html)

## Example Usage

Creating some group

```hcl
resource "databricks_group" "this" {
  display_name = "Some Group"
  allow_cluster_create = true
  allow_instance_pool_create = true
}
```

Adding [databricks_user](user.md) as [databricks_group_member](group_member.md) of some group

```hcl
resource "databricks_group" "this" {
  display_name = "Some Group"
  allow_cluster_create = true
  allow_instance_pool_create = true
}

resource "databricks_user" "this" {
    user_name = "someone@example.com"
}

resource "databricks_group_member" "vip_member" {
    group_id = databricks_group.this.id
    member_id = databricks_user.this.id
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `display_name` -  (Required) This is the display name for the given group.
* `allow_cluster_create` -  (Optional) This is a field to allow the group to have [cluster](cluster.md) create priviliges. More fine grained permissions could be assigned with [databricks_permissions](permissions.md#Cluster-usage) and [cluster_id](permissions.md#cluster_id) argument. Everyone without `allow_cluster_create` arugment set, but with [permission to use](permissions.md#Cluster-Policy-usage) Cluster Policy would be able to create clusters, but within boundaries of that specific policy.
* `allow_instance_pool_create` -  (Optional) This is a field to allow the group to have [instance pool](instance_pool.md) create priviliges. More fine grained permissions could be assigned with [databricks_permissions](permissions.md#Instance-Pool-usage) and [instance_pool_id](permissions.md#instance_pool_id) argument.

## Attribute Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` -  The id for the group object.

## Import
