# databricks_app Data Source

-> This feature is in [Public Preview](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/release-types.html).

[Databricks Apps](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/databricks-apps/index.html) run directly on a customerâ€™s Databricks instance, integrate with their data, use and extend Databricks services, and enable users to interact through single sign-on.
