Hi there,

Thank you for opening an issue. Please note that we try to keep the Databricks Provider issue tracker reserved for bug reports and feature requests. For general usage questions, please see: https://www.terraform.io/community.html.

### Terraform Version
Run `terraform -v` to show the version. If you are not running the latest version of Terraform, please upgrade because your issue may have already been fixed.

### Affected Resource(s)
Please list the resources as a list, for example:
- databricks_cluster
- databricks_job

If this issue appears to affect multiple resources, it may be an issue with Terraform's core, so please mention this.

### Environment variable names
To get relevant environment variable _names_ please copypaste the output of the following command:
`$ env | sort | grep -E 'DATABRICKS|AWS|AZURE|ARM|TEST' | awk -F= '{print $1}'`

### Terraform Configuration Files
```hcl
# Copy-paste your Terraform configurations here - for large Terraform configs,
# please use a service like Dropbox and share a link to the ZIP file. For
# security, you can also encrypt the files using our GPG public key.
```

### Debug Output
Please add turn on logging, e.g. `TF_LOG=DEBUG terraform apply` and run command again, paste it to gist & provide the link to gist. If you're still willing to paste in log output, make sure you provide only relevant log lines with requests.

### Panic Output
If Terraform produced a panic, please provide a link to a GitHub Gist containing the output of the `crash.log`.
