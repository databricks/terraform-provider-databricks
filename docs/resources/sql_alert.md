  path = "/Shared/Queries"
}

resource "databricks_sql_query" "this" {
  data_source_id = databricks_sql_endpoint.example.data_source_id
  name           = "My Query Name"
  query          = "SELECT 1 AS p1, 2 as p2"
  parent         = "folders/${databricks_directory.shared_dir.object_id}"
}

resource "databricks_sql_alert" "alert" {
  query_id = databricks_sql_query.this.id
  name     = "My Alert"
  parent   = "folders/${databricks_directory.shared_dir.object_id}"
  rearm    = 1
  options {
    column = "p1"
    op     = "=="
    value  = "2"
