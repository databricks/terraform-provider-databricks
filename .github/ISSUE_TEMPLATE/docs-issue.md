Hi there,

Thank you for opening an issue. Please note that we try to keep the Databricks Provider issue tracker reserved for bug reports and feature requests. For general Terraform questions, please see: https://www.terraform.io/community.html.
This template is for both adding enhancement as well as pointing out issues with the provider documentation.

Every doc page has anchor links for all the headings please post that here.

expected please point that out.
